# Introduction {#intro}

Soil organic carbon (SOC) is important for maintaining the structure and function of soils. It is involved in nutrient retention and cycling whilst enhancing soil physical structure, helping soils to retain water (reducing flood risk) and allowing improved root growth (enhancing food production). Moreover, it is an important store of carbon, which needs to be protected to avoid it being emitted to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. A healthy soil may even accumulate more carbon over time, locking up atmospheric carbon dioxide and contributing to climate change mitigation.  

Under the Kyoto Protocol the UK is required to make estimates of net carbon emissions to the atmosphere, including emissions and removals by soils linked to land-use. However, knowledge of soil carbon stocks and changes is limited; previous work from the National Soil Resources Institute and partners suggested that soils in England and Wales were losing carbon due to climate change, but this has been contested by subsequent studies based on more comprehensive soils data which suggest that the soil carbon stocks have remained stable.

# Evidence {#ev}
The reported results are split into two groups, those representing the Wider Wales part of the survey and those that represent the Targeted part of the survey. The Wider Wales sampling is joined to the Countryside Survey long-term monitoring by the dashed line, and provides a baseline against which change can be assessed. The targeted sampling contains areas that are prioritised in Glastir for targeted interventions. The results presented here serve as a check to see if the samples in the targeted squares differ from Wider Wales.

The graph shows the GMEP data for carbon concentration for 2013 compared with data collected since 1978 by the Countryside Survey. The results for Wider Wales sampling, show that no significant change in soil carbon concentration has occurred between the last Countryside Survey sampling in 2007 and GMEP in 2013. The red square shows the Targeted sampling mean carbon concentration lying above the Wider Wales value; these squares are monitored specifically for soil carbon and pollution. The fact they lie above indicates they are being targeted correctly. 

For interpretation of the scale, soil type based on soil organic matter content is defined as mineral soil (0-44 g C kg^-1^), humus-mineral (44-165 g C kg^-1^ ), organo-mineral (165-330 g C kg^-1^) and organic soil (330-550 g C kg^-1^), the maximum carbon content is 550 g C kg^-1^.

# Method {#meth}
Soil samples are collected each year in plastic sleeves, 15 cm long and 5cm wide. Loss-on-Ignition, (LOI) was measured on a 10 g air dried sub-sample taken after sieving to 2 mm. The sub-sample was dried at 105^o^C for 16 hours to remove moisture, weighed, then combusted at 375^o^C for 16 hours. The cooled sample was then weighed, and the loss-on-ignition (%) calculated. Soil carbon concentration was determined, using a total elemental analyser; the method used was the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Lancaster accredited method SOP3102. The LOI values were calibrated to carbon concentration using a multiplication factor of 0.55 determined from the calibration with the total carbon in order to be consistent with Countryside Survey data.

# Trade-offs & Co-benefits {#coben}
One of the powers of the Glastir monitoring is that it helps relate soil carbon stocks to vegetation, habitat and other environmental data allowing easier assessment, and potentially better targeting of land-management activities aimed at mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The data provided by this survey contributes to the knowledge of how soil carbon is changing, how this relates to vegetation change and land use and management and provides evidence of the effectiveness of soil protection legislation in Wales. There is generally a trade-off between maintaining high levels of soil organic carbon (SOC) and productivity. The most carbon is stored in peat bogs which are low productivity systems, whereas the least amount of SOC is stored in arable mineral soils which are continually ploughed and cropped. Fens are perhaps the exception to this being high in carbon and productivity, having been drained; but we are losing carbon from these soils. Maintaining healthy levels of soil organic matter can provide an economic buffer against market price spikes, for example against fuel and fertiliser costs in some agri-ecosystems. The soil organic matter acts as a nutrient reserve that can be accessed at times when prices are high and rebuilt in between.
